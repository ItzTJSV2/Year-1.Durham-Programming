    "1. Below are two functions that solve problems that we have seen previously. They are different methods by which we can generate lists of prime numbers. Use the timing and profiling magic functions to determine how these algorithms scale as you change the size of the input. You could try doubling the value of maxPrime repeatedly and see how that impacts the data that is output. There is printing code commented out - you can uncomment this to prove the algorithms work, but for profiling it is best if these are commented."

    "2. Use your knowledge of the random module to generate a list of random integers called `L`. You should be able to control the size of this list with a variable. Make a copy of your list using the copy module, and call it `L1`, so you have two independant copies of that list. Vary the size of your list using the variable you assigned for this purpose, and see how the performance of these functions scale as you change that size of the input list. You might notice some interesting differences between using quite small lists (under 200 elements) and larger lists (over 1000 elements). Patterns in the data are much easier to spot with large lists (over 100000 elements)\n"

    "4. Design a simple substitution cipher using string manipulation. There are lots of ways to tackle this problem. An easy way to start might be to say that all plaintext messages are in capital letters, and encrypted text is in lower case. If you're feeling confident, turn it into a guessing game. Collect input from a user that allows them to suggest a replacement of one letter with another. You don't have to tell the user they are correct! You could implement an \"Undo\" feature, where you store their suggestions, and allow them to undo them. You can see that this could quickly become a large program, but this is the type of project you can spend a little time on to really get used to using lots of different aspects of Python."
