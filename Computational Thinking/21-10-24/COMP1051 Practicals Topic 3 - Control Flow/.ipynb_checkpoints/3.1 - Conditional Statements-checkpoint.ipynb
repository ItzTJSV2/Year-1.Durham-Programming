    "## Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditions statements in programming give us an option on what code should be executed and what shouldn't, given a certain condition. This allows us to make decisions in our code based on the data that we encounter. A common phrase you'll see when learning conditionals is: \"if this, then that\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "This would be an example of a one-way if statement as they are referred to in the Perkovic text book. We will see through the course of this notebook that not only can we use one-way if statements like these in Python, but also two-way if statements, and the nesting of if statements inside one another to allow for more complex decision making. Key to all of this is the use of indentation in Python, as it explicitly describes what code is inside a conditional and therefore should be executed if the condition is met.\n",

    "When we run this code block we should get two print statements back, but if you change the variable `temp` to have the value 10, you will notice you only get a single message printed out. This is the basic concept of a conditional statement, the statement `print(\"Its very cold today!\")` will only print if the condition is met. The condition is this case if a comparison operation between the variable `temp` and the integer `5`. This comparison will evaluate to a boolean, either `True` or `False`. \n",
