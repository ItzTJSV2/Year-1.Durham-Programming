    "Loops in programming give us an option to repeat a section of code, either for a fixed number of times, or more generally until a certain condition is met. Python gives us two keywords for creating loops in our code, and they are `for` and `while`. In most situations you can use these interchangeably, however the usual convention is to use a for loop when you know how many times you want to repeat the execution of your code block (i.e. you repeat things a fixed number of times) and use a while loop when repeating a code block for an unknown number of times, until a condition is met.\n"

    "We'll start by looking at for loops. In the example below, we take a list of integers, and we want to print them all out. We could do this just using the indexing operator that we have seen previously, but that requires us knowing the size of the list in advance to make sure we have enough print statements to print out every element. However, using a for loop it won't matter how many elements are in our list, Python will handle things for us."

The keyword `in` makes the statement read sensibly, and gives you some intuition in to what Python is trying to do. The object to the right of `in` in our code is a list, and a list is an example of an iterable object in Python.

The general idea is that the code looks at each element of the list in turn, and temporarily stores that elements in the variable `e`. We can use that variable in the indented code within our loop, and then once we have finished all of the indented code, we return to the for loop, grab the next element of our list, place that in the variable `e` and continue. Once we've used all of the elements of the list, we move on to the non-indented code that follows the for loop.\n",
