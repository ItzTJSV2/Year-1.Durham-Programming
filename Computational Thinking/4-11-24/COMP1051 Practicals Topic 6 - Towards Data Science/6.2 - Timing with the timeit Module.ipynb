For example, if your runtime data shows a clear doubling when the size of the input doubles it suggests that your implementation has linear complexity, $O(n)$. Similarly if the runtime data shows a quadrupling pattern when the input size is doubled your implementation likely has quadratic complexity, $O(n^2)$.
